                                                           BELAH SEARCH ENGINE

Welcome to BELAH Search Engine! This is a simple search engine desktop application created using Winforms in C#. This app was made by a team of five students from the School of Information Sciences at Addis Ababa University, including Azeb Mihiretie, Lydiya Fikrie, Bereket Gebeyaw, Hayat Ebrahim, and Esubalew Chekol.

The purpose of this search engine is to allow users to search through specific websites using web scraping technology. Currently, the app is implemented to crawl through Wikipedia, the AAU website, and a certain dictionary website. By registering with the app, users can have their activities tracked.

This project was submitted to the C# instructor at Addis Ababa University as a 3rd year first semester final project. We are proud to share this app on GitHub as a learning resource for other students. Our hope is to encourage other students to refrain from copying code and instead use our project as inspiration for their own development projects. Thank you for using BELAH Search Engine!
